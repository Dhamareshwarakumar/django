cmd> django-admin startproject <project_name>       # creates a project
cmd> python manage.py runserver                     # fires up python server
cmd> python manage.py startapp <app_name>           # creates an app

after creating app we have to set navigation path for it...
create urls.py under first_app
    >>> from django.urls import path
    >>> from . import views

    setting url urlpatterns
    >>> urlpatterns = [
        path('/', views.home, name='home')
    ]

now when we head to / path it asks for home function in views file
so lets create home function in views.py
>>> from django.http import HttpResponse            # HttpResponse is for sending respone
>>> def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("HelloWorld")

it is completed setiing path for our app
but we also set path for project so that it knows there is our app
so navigate project folder and then urls.py
>>> from django.urls import path, include
>>> urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('first_app.urls'))
]

setting up templates
create a folder under root director say <templates>
add this path to settings of the project
find template.DIR and append
>>> os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '<templates>')


create a 'static' folder so that all static files can reside
now we have to map these static files assets of djangoproject
navigate to project settings
>>> STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
]
>>> STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'assets')
cmd> python manage.py collectstatic


for accessing these static files add
{% load static %}
in the index page or page that is referencing to
and also add
{% static '<address>' %}
to every src and href that are referring to static folder
