cmd> django-admin startproject <project_name>       # creates a project
cmd> python manage.py runserver                     # fires up python server
cmd> python manage.py startapp <app_name>           # creates an app

after creating app we have to set navigation path for it...
create urls.py under first_app
    >>> from django.urls import path
    >>> from . import views

    setting url urlpatterns
    >>> urlpatterns = [
        path('/', views.home, name='home')
    ]

now when we head to / path it asks for home function in views file
so lets create home function in views.py
>>> from django.http import HttpResponse            # HttpResponse is for sending respone
>>> def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("HelloWorld")

it is completed setiing path for our app
but we also set path for project so that it knows there is our app
so navigate project folder and then urls.py
>>> from django.urls import path, include
>>> urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('first_app.urls'))
]
